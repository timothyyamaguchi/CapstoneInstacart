	I want to be able to determine which products will an instacart consumer purchase again

2. Who is  your client and why do they care about this problem? In other words, what will your client do or decide based on your analysis that they wouldn't have otherwise.
	My client will be able to use this data to:

		Accounting for holding costs and spoilage determine which products would be the most logical to have on hand
	Run a regression/machine learning model to determine which products a consumer is most likely to purchase

5. What are your deliverables? Typically, this would include code, along with a paper and/or slide deck.
	Code
	Slide Deck
